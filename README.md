# Act 1 - Project Setup
 
## #1 - Meet the team   
 
*Goal*: Get acquainted with your teammates.

*Suggested Actions*: 

> Read each other's intro stories.

> Share a project or two you are most proud of in your learning journey.

> Share some prime picks from your gif collection.

*Icebreakers*:

> What time zone are you in?

> What sort of music do you like to code to? 

> What is your preferred learning style (videos, docs, dialoge etc)?

> What are your favorite YouTube channels, subreddits or blogs?

> What technologies are you most comfortable using and explaining?

> What technologies are you most interested in learning this Voyage?

## #2 — Set Goals & Expectations 

*Goal*: Determine the team's learning expectations and availability.

*Commitment*: 

> It is critical to make sure that everyone is realistic in their level of commitment and availability.

> Working less than you commit to is disrespectful to your teammates and can stunt the team's progress and morale.

> Typically team members commit 4-10 hours a week towards the project.

*Learning Goals*: 

> Evaluate everyone's current technical abilities.

> Determine at least one primary technical learning goal for each teammate

> Pick something that is 25% outside of the team's comfort zone / skillset. 

> Any further and you will likely be overwhelmed. 

> Any less and you are limiting your rate of learning. 

*Voyages go by faster than you think and you need to focus on learning through building rather than getting caught in research rabbit-holes*.

## #3 — Set a Team-Lead 

*Goal*: As a team decide who will be the Team-Lead (similar to a Project Manager). 

*Commitment*: 

> This may be challenging for the group, but it is critical that the team sets a Team-Lead. 

> The team may want to do it together, but our experience is that teams who go with that style almost always fail. 

> The Team-Lead will serve as the de facto Project Manager and will have access to resources and will be added to a support channel with all the Voyage's Team-Leads. 

*Learning Goals*: 

> Either someone volunteers or the you suggest someone based on their background/ schedule. 

> Feel free to message @chance if your team is having a tough time with this. 

> People often think that the Team-Lead should be the most knowledgeable member, but we have not found that to be the case at all. We will provide support and resources so that anyone can take on this role. 

*A Chingu-Facilitator will reach out after the first week to find out who is the Team-Lead. Teams that can't decide on a Team-Lead may be subject to closure as progress is tough without someone invested in moving it forward.*.

## #4 — Brainstorm Project Options

*Goal*: Decide on a project to pursue.

*Tips*:

> Stay focused on what is possible as a balance of the cohort season's length, team experience and the commitment 
level.

> Remember to incorporate as many team learning goals as are feasible. 

> *The goal is to learn something new not to stay stuck only working with what you know.*

*The Stack*:

> Front End - consider the library / framework your project will use

> Back End - consider the backend language and library / framework

> Database - consider the database type and ORM your team will use to interact with it

*It is better to underpromise and overdeliver _especially if this is your first Voyage_*
     

## #5 —Define your Workflow

*Goal*: Decide on which workflow tools the team will use.

*Tips*:

> Don't go overboard! Workflow tools are only useful when they are used. Keep it simple so that using the tools 
feels effortless rather than a chore.

> If you don't already have a workflow or specific tools in mind consider the suggestions below.

*Suggested Workflow Tools*

>Besides the obvious Slack and Github the following are tools that work for many Chingu teams

> [Waffle](https://www.waffle.io) - Trello and Github had a baby that makes project management a breeze

> [Discord](https://www.discord.com) - "Always-on" communication tool. Leave it on mute while you work then unmute 
as needed to gain access to team mates for problem solving detours. Use it for clear audio while using Google 
Hangouts (don't forget to mute the echo from Hangouts!)

> [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) - A screensharing / pair-programming must (until VSC Live comes 
out!!)

*Suggested Use*: 

> Hold a meeting on Discord and / or Hangouts to discuss the key steps required to complete the next sprint.

> Use Waffle to compartmentalize the steps of the sprints into grab-and-go tasks.

> Leave Discord on and unmute as needed to discuss and conquer roadblocks.

> Use Slack for short code snippets. Use Hangouts to screenshare for more complex debugging.

*A proper workflow and concise collection of workflow tools is what makes the difference between a team that makes it and one that doesn't.*
      
## #6 — Set up

*Goal*: Set up and explore your team's workflow tools.

*Tips*:

> Check to see if your pre-made Voyage team repo is functional and the proper permissions and settings are 
configured.

> Ask for help from the community with setting up tools if you get stuck. 

> Don't get turned off because the setup seems daunting. It's a one time process - take the time to do it right!

*Required*:

> Make sure everyone uses the tools. 

> Walk through an example usage of each tool and how they all come together.

> Work out any kinks in people's microphones, internet connections, permissions etc.

*The first sprint IS NOT the time to learn how to use the tools at hand.* 

*Get comfortable early so you can focus on building not technical difficulties!* 

## #7— Define the MVP  
   
*Goal*: Hold a meeting to decide on the minimum viable product (MVP).

*Tips*:

> Deciding on the MVP for the project is the most important step your team must take before embarking on your 
Voyage.

> Consider the features that can together serve, at minimum, as a functioning prototype of the project's vision.

> Defining the MVP is committing to the bare minimum you and the team will accomplish before the cohort deadline.

*Focus Points*:

> Front End - consider the views and their associated functionality

> Back End - consider the endpoints, routes and associated logic

> Database - consider the complexity of the database and associated models

> Deployment - consider how / where you will host the project

*Schedule a Meeting*

> Schedule your next meeting to plan your first sprint!

*Don't throw away those features and moonshot ideas that fall outside of the scope of the MVP!*

*Shoot for finishing the MVP ahead of schedule so the extra time can be used to implement those additional 
features and polish* 
----

# Act 2 - Development Sprints

## #1 Plan the Sprint
      
*Goal*: Subdivide the MVP into a feature(s) sprint.

*Notes*: 

> Determine a starting point for working towards the completion of the MVP.

> The tasks for each sprint *should require 1 week or less to complete*.

> Do your best but don't worry if you underestimate the required time - you can reflect and adjust in the next 
sprint.

*Tips*:

> Select one or more top-level features from the MVP and explore how it can be broken down into individual tasks.

> Think about the order in which the tasks will be completed and mark those that can be worked on independently or 
in parallel.

> The team should take ample time to explore the sprint and all of its tasks. Everyone should be aware of the 
sprint on a conceptual and somewhat of a technical level.

> High level implementation details can be discussed but don't lose time writing out any code or specific details.

> Finer details and coding will take place after the sprint has been thoroughly explored.

*Workflow*

> Now is the time to create cards for each of the tasks. 

> Write the cards by adding descriptive titles and core details of the task as bullet points.

> The cards should serve as guidelines to each task with links to key references or specific notes that may be 
forgotten.

> Finish by reviewing and assigning the cards together as a team so that everyone is on the same page and knows 
what they are responsible for.

*Don't spend too much time writing the cards or getting caught up with all the fancy buttons!* 

## #2 — Begin the Sprint

*Goal*: Turn all that talk into code!

*Tips*:

> Communicate when you're stuck. Don't stare at a screen alone.

> Everyone is here to learn - be patient with each other and encourage open discussion and brainstorming solutions 
to roadblocks.

> Use the help channels and friends from other teams to resolve complex issues if your team is stumped or 
unavailable.

*Schedule a Meeting*

> Schedule a time a few days from now to check in with everyone and make sure forward progress is being made by 
the team.

*Remote dev work is hard especially for beginners. Communicating openly and readily can make the difference 
between meeting a deadline or losing momentum.*

## #3 —Team Standup Review

*Goal*: Review the team's progress on the sprint.

*Tips*:

> Start by assessing everyone's status in the sprint.

> Discuss any roadblocks that are holding back progress.

> Explore solutions together and construct an actionable plan to move forward.

> Celebrate completed tasks and share the lessons learned in working on them.

> Assess the remaining tasks and take note of how close you are to meeting this sprint's weekly deadline.

*If anyone learned anything particularly valuable or overcame an irritating block be sure to share the experience in a Medium blog or discussion in the Chingu chat.*

## #4 — Sprint Progress Review

*Goal*: Review the team's progress on the sprint.

*Steps*:

> Assess everyone's status in the sprint.

> Discuss any roadblocks that are holding back progress.

> Explore solutions together and construct an actionable plan to move forward.

> Celebrate completed tasks and share the lessons learned in working on them.

> Assess the remaining tasks and take note of how close you are to meeting this sprint's weekly deadline.

*Tips*:

> Make sure that everyone is testing their code along the way.

> During the next phase of reviewing and merging the code no glaring issues or immediate bugs should be present.

> Take ownership of your tasks and make sure they have been vetted before moving onto the next one.

## #5 — Code Review & Merging

*Goal*: Review the code and merge into the development branch.

*Tips*:

> Cross-review each other's code and prevent merging without review.

> Engage in thoughtful disagreement by challenging each other respsectfully.

> Ask for clarification and add comments wherever needed.

> Openly explain decisions and implementation details.

> Test completed tasks whenever possible and seek out bugs to catch.

> Work on maintaining a consistent style across the team's code. Let it come organically or use a linter rules 
such as AirBnB or Google.

*Write detailed pull request notes to maintain a clear history of the project and its progress. These will also help team members cross-review your PRs*

## #6 — Completed Sprint Review

*Goal*: Go over the sprint and reflect on the experience gained.

*Steps*:

> Assess the number of remaining tasks

> Determine why they were left incomplete

> Discuss how the next sprint will be improved by factoring in the lessons learned

> Discuss how the workflow worked to or against your team's advantage

> Discuss any new ideas that stemmed from completing the tasks. Create notes or cards to keep these ideas handy 
for the future. 

*Be patient with each other and understand that it's okay to miss a deadline. Carry over the remaining tasks and plan better for the next one!*

Note: Repeat sprints until the project MVP is complete.

# Act 3 - Project Closure

## #1 - Tidy up your code & file structure

*Goal*: Have a codebase that you can look back on proudly in a few months and still understand what you were doing.
  
  When your code is clean, well structured, and *DRY*, you can easily share it with other programmers, possible employers, and future teammates.
  
  *Tips*:

  > Remove extra and unnecessary \`console.log(...)\` statements.

  > Comment your code thoroughly. (If you're using Javascript, consider the JSDoc pattern.)

  > Factor out any repetitive pieces of logic. Try to use more generic functions. (*Be careful!:* Don't make 
things too generic! It could make the code harder to understand.)

  > Use common file & folder structures and established community best practices in design patterns.
  
  *DRY* (*D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself): Try to factor out portions of your logic into reusable functions, classes, and components so as to avoid repeating yourself. Code that is factored this way is said to be *DRY*.
  
  *IMPORTANT:* After modifying your code, make sure you test it thoroughly so as to make sure you didn't break anything!

## #2 - Polish the experience

 *Goal*: Add the finishing touches to make this project really shine! This is where (if you have the time) you can go that extra mile.
  
  An optimized experience reflects well on your abilities and increases the credebility of the project.
  
  *Tips*:
 
 > Make it fully responsive and check your design on common screen sizes.

  > Make your methods and logic more efficient.

  > Decrease the size of what is downloaded by the user (At least on first load.)

## #3 - Deploy it!

*Goal*: Make your project publicly accessible.
  
  Once you deploy your project you can then share it with others so that they can review and use it. This is especially useful when you want to get feedback or just when you want to perform some user tests. Deploying is also useful because it allows you to provide a link to a live demo version on your resume and your portfolio.
  
  *Tips*:

  > Consider a simple, managed hosting service like Heroku or Google App Engine.

  > Don't worry too much about infrastructure design, just use the most basic setup possible so as not to run into 
issues.

  > Search online for deployment strategies that match your stack and your use case. You will find many articles and tutorials with step by step guides on how to deploy your favourite stack on a popular managed service.

## #4 - Share it with trusted & experienced colleagues

*Goal*: Gather important feedback and perform some basic user testing.
  
  Sharing your project with peers is an extremely helpful way of gathering useful feedback. This could be feedback on the experience of your app or feedback on the actual code. You can then use this feedback to further polish the experience. Another benefit to having many people use your application is that you are more likely to catch bugs.
  
  *Tips*:

  > Share your project on chingu in #community-chat and ask people to check it out.

  > Share it with programmers you personally know such as friends, classmates, or work colleagues.

  > Don't explain the application too much. Just give them the basic idea and let them figure out how to use it. 
If they can't figure out how it works or if they are stuck on something then there is probably something wrong 
with the experience.

## #5 - Share it with the world

*Goal*: More feedback and testing!
  
  When you share your project publicly you are likely to get even more useful feedback and catch more bugs since your audience is now much larger and more diverse. This also adds to your 'online presence' which is extremely valuable when applying for jobs.
  
  *Tips*:

  > Write a medium article announcing the project and asking people to try it out.

  > Share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and even on professional networks such as linkedin.

  > If you are part of any other technical/hacker communities consider sharing it there too.

  > Make sure the tier of hosting you are using is ready to handle the additional traffic.

## #6 - Retrospective meeting

*Goal*: Solidify the experience and look back on everything you have accomplished.
  
  Organize a meeting with your team to discuss everything you have worked on, the outcome you have reached, the things you have learnt, your experience, and maybe even discuss the future of your project if you would like it to continue. Take this as an opportunity to compliment and, *more importantly*, critique each other. This will help you improve your soft skills and also provide your teammates with important feedback that they can also use to improve themselves.
  
  *Tips*:

  > Discuss the highs and the lows. Discuss the reasons behind the lows.

  > Give honest and critical feeback but don't be unnecessarily mean.

  > Take feedback from your teammates with an open mind. Don't be quick to snap or defend yourself. Use this as an 
opportunity to grow.

## #7 - Document the experience

*Goal*: Increase your online presence and practice writing about your experience.
  
  Write about everything. Not just the actual project but also your experience, your thoughts, and your teammates. This is helpful because as you move forward in your career as a programmer you will have points of reference to look back on to see how you have grown not just technically but also in terms of soft skills.
  
  Getting into the habit of writing a lot will help you increase your online presence and ultimately improve your chances of getting a job.
  

  *Tips*:

  > Document everything regarding the experience.

  > Have your teammates review it before publishing. They might catch something you have forgotten.

  > Share the article with your peers and with the public to increase your online presence.

## #8 - The Voyage is Complete 



##FAQ Notes:

Chingu Code of Conduct
Behavior that will get you kicked out:

BASICS
What is Chingu?
Chingu is building a global collaboration capital for 21st century tech-learners** to gain experience, meet friends and generate impact through building projects. 

Chingu’s mission is to empower the planet’s tech-learners with 21st century skills by facilitating diverse collaboration experiences and build-to-learn projects.
**Developers, designers, data scientists, and digital marketers can all find a home here. 

What is a Voyage?
A Voyage is an ambitious community with shared goals and an opportunity to gain experience learning and building with a team. 

Those that are accepted are organized into remote teams, given prompts and various tools to aid them accelerate their learning. 

How long is the Voyage?
A Voyage lasts 8 weeks. 

Where is Chingu located? 
Chingu and all the Voyages we run are 100% remote. 

How many people are in a typical Voyage?
A Voyage has between 200-300 people, with an average of 75 different countries represented. 

What are my Voyage options?
See the current Voyage list for dates.     

Is this program only for Full-time members? 
No, Voyages are open to both Full-time and Part-time learners. 

What are the technical qualifications?
You need to have built something. Your very first project should not be a team project. If you don’t have a finished project, go build and then apply. 

What are the non-technical qualifications?
Soft skills are the greatest skill we can learn, and are paramount to any team’s success. We don’t expect you to be a master, but we do expect you to have read the prep material on soft skills. 

How much does it cost?
Voyages are free. We are developing another product that will have a price, but that is still in development. 

Who is the typical Chingu Voyage applicant?
Open to collaboration, accountable, and hungry to level-up their skills. 

As far as skill and experience level, if 0 is just started to learn today and 100 is got a developer job, Chingu members come from the 15 - 150 range. New learners who have built a project or two → experienced professional developers learning new skills (new frameworks, leadership, mentorship). 

CURRICULUM
What skills will I learn at Chingu?
In a typical Voyage, you can expect to have the opportunity to earn various Hard and Soft skills. 

Hard skills: 
Git/github
Accelerated 

Soft skills: 
Leadership
Time management 
Collaboration
Confidence 
Empathy
Conflict resolution 
Adaptability
Creativity  

Why can we use any tech-stack?
Yes, Chingu is tech-stack agnostic and the team decides together what tech-stack to use. 

A big portion of our team-formation algorithm is connecting people who have similar experience levels and tech-stack preferences. 

Most people who join Chingu thus far are into Web-Development, and the most common stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for the more experienced and HTML/CSS/Basic Javascript for the newer learners. 

What's a typical day like in the Voyage?
This really depends on the team and particular Voyage, but building something or learning what is needed to build something likely on an average day. All with the support of a community doing the same thing. 

Can I really become a developer by doing Voyages?
Yes, many people get a job both during and after each Voyage. Though see below for the next question related to this. 

Will I be guaranteed a job after completing a project?
People are constantly getting jobs in the Chingu ecosystem, but completing one Voyage does not guarantee you will get a job. We launch teams at all levels - from newer learners building landing pages to experienced experts building full stack applications. 

That being said, by doing Voyages you gain in-demand hard skills and learn how to work in a modern team, the two core aspects all employees look for.

I’m an absolute beginner with zero experience or knowledge in the subject matter you facilitate (e.g., web development, digital marketing). Is Chingu still for me? 
No, we encourage absolute beginners to build a few projects before applying to Chingu. Your very first project should not be a team project. 

What makes you different from other coding bootcamps?
Chingu isn’t a coding bootcamp - we’re a collaboration capital for ambitious learners. 

I'm ready. How do I apply?
Simply sign-up at chingu.io and you will be prompted to apply. 

How do I secure my spot in a course?
If you’re a first time member, there’s no way to secure a spot, though we try to give as many new people an opportunity. 

Once you are accepted, you can secure your spot by maintaining a high reputation score.  

Besides the hours spent communicating with my team, how much time do I need to dedicate to a Voyage outside of communication?
This is dependent on your skill level, the team dynamics, and how outside of your comfort zone the project is.

For example, if you’re using a tech-stack you’re familiar with, you would need to spend much less time than if you’re learning a new framework to complete your tasks. 

I’m interested, but have very little programming experience - how can I prepare?
Our mantra is “build-to-learn” so we recommend people go out and build some basic projects. 

What will happen after I complete an application?
You will receive a notification that your application has been received. 

We review applications once a week, though it can sometimes take 1-3 weeks to get a response back. 

When should I apply to get into a particular Voyage cohort?
We typically run Voyages every few months, so you can apply at anytime. That being said, to be safe we recommend applying 6-8 weeks early. 

What if I am accepted into Chingu and need to change my start date?
For reasonable issues or emergencies we can defer enrollment. 

CHINGU’S PACE
What is the policy on absence for special events, weddings, trips, etc?
It all depends on the specific context. The Voyage is 8 weeks, so for most cases as long as you communicate and the team adapts as necessary it’s fine. 

Laziness or apathy are not appropriate excuses. 

Chingu is a meritocracy and your actions now will dictate your opportunities in the future on the platform. Your peers will be rating you out of 5 each week as a team-mate, and the average of those ratings will dictate whether you can join a Voyage in the future, as well as the type of team-mates you may have (ex. People who have a score of 2 likely have issues with unreliability, and it wouldn’t be fair to place them with someone who has proven to be reliable). 

What is the policy on dropping out for emergencies?
Emergencies happen and

Applications / Pre-Voyage

How can I prepare before a Voyage begins?
Upon acceptance, you’ll be given a Voyage-prep roadmap, with various resources and suggestions to help you prepare for your Voyage.

How are teams matched together?
We use a variety of parameters and this is changing constantly as we improve, but it involves timezone, tech-stack familiarity and commitment availability.

During the Voyage
Who decides projects?
The team decides on the project. We provide project prompts based on the team’s general level, and highly encourage inexperienced teams to follow these prompts, but ultimately it is the team who decides. 

Are all projects unique?
No. About half the projects are unique projects and the other half are clones of popular startups like Airbnb or Spotify. The goal at Chingu is to learn and build, so both are welcomed! 

How do you work together?
Every team is unique, but all teams will be given the same structure and tools to help them work together. 

You’re given a team Slack channel for communication, a project roadmap to follow, and if possible a Project Manager. We also have mandatory weekly check-in forms to help ensure team communication and accountability. 

What platform do teams work on?
A typical team will utilize a workflow that includes the following platforms: 

Slack/ Discord/ Google Hangouts for team communication and meetings
Git/ Github for a code repository
Github projects, Waffle or Trello for task management 
Chingu platform for Team Standups & motivation 

What if I have questions along the way?
You definitely will have questions and there will be many areas to ask them, including team channels, community chats, a question channel, and by making a ticket.

What happens if we don't complete our project in time
In a typical Voyage we may launch 70-110 different teams. These teams will range from people working on landing pages, to data science projects to full stack applications. Projects will have different ambition levels and scope, and some won’t be able to finish in the time frame. That is completely okay and we always have some teams that transfer into the next Voyage to continue working on it.


Team Issues

What happens if a teammate has disappeared?

What happens if a project manager has disappeared?

What happens if I want to change the Project Manager?

What if I need to drop out of the voyage?

What happens if a teammate or team is not responsive / lost the momentum?


After the Voyage

When do we submit the projects?
Projects are submitted when the project MVP (Minimum Viable Project) is completed before or at the end of the 8 week Voyage. 

Eligible project MVPs will be showcased in Chingu’s Project Showcase article. 

How do we submit projects?
They’ll be Project submission form in your team portal where the project can be submitted. Towards the end of the Voyage we will notify the community with clear instructions on how to submit as well. 

What happens next?
You get a job, take a break, and/or apply for another Voyage!
